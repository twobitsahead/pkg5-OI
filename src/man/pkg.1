.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
\fBpkg\fR is the retrieval client for the Image Packaging System. With a valid configuration, \fBpkg\fR can be invoked to create locations for packages to be installed, called images, and install packages into those images. Packages are published by publishers, who can make their packages available at one or more repositories, or in package archives. \fBpkg\fR retrieves packages from a publisher\&'s repository or package archives and installs the packages into an image.
.sp
.LP
Packages can only be installed into file systems that are part of a BE. For example, on a default Oracle Solaris 11 installation, only datasets under \fBrpool/ROOT/\fIBEname\fR/\fR are supported for package operations.
.sp
.LP
A publisher name identifies a person, group of persons, or an organization as the source of one or more packages. To avoid publisher name collisions and help identify the publisher, a best practice is to use a domain name that represents the entity publishing the packages as a publisher name.
.sp
.LP
A repository is a location where clients can publish and retrieve package content (files contained within the package such as programs and documents) and metadata (information about the package such as its name and description). As an example, a publisher named \fBexample.org\fR might have their repository located at the URI \fBhttp://example.org/repository\fR.
.sp
.LP
\fBpkg\fR can also uninstall packages, refresh publisher metadata (such as the list of available packages), validate package installation in an image, and query the image for various tokens. These queries can also be made of \fBpkg\fR(7) repositories.
.sp
.LP
Images can be of three types: full images, capable of providing a complete system; partial images, which are linked to a full image (parent image), but do not provide a complete system on their own; and user images.

.sp .6
.RS 4n
Install and update the specified packages to the newest version that match \fIpkg_fmri_pattern\fR allowed by the packages installed in the image. To explicitly request the latest version of a package, use \fBlatest\fR for the version portion of \fIpkg_fmri_pattern\fR. For example, specify \fBvim@latest\fR. The \fIpkg_fmri_pattern\fR pattern can include the \fB?\fR and \fB*\fR characters as \fBglob\fR(3C)-style wildcards to match one or more packages.
.sp
Versions older or newer than what is already installed can be specified to perform in-place downgrades or upgrades of specific packages. Updating specific packages across package rename or obsolete boundaries is not supported.
.sp
Any preserved configuration files that are part of packages to be downgraded and that have been changed since the original version was installed are renamed using the extension \fB\&.update\fR. For more information about how the package system determines which files to preserve, and how these files are preserved during package upgrades, see "File Actions" in the \fBpkg\fR(7) man page.
.sp
Packages are selected based on publisher search order and stickiness. See the \fBpkg publisher\fR and \fBpkg set-publisher\fR commands for information about search order and stickiness. If the \fIpkg_fmri_pattern\fR does not specify the publisher, the first publisher that provides a matching package is used as the installation source. If that publisher does not provide a version of the package that can be installed in this image, then the installation operation fails. Use the \fBpkg list -a\fR command to see which publishers provide a version of the package that can be installed in this image.
.sp
If more than one \fIpkg_fmri_pattern\fR is specified, and if any of the specified packages cannot be installed in this image, then none of the specified packages will be installed.
.sp
Some configuration files might be renamed or replaced during the installation process. For more information about how the package system determines which files to preserve, and how they are preserved during package operations, see "File Actions" in the \fBpkg\fR(7) man page.
.sp
If a package is on the avoid list, installing it removes it from that list.

Specify the number of child images to update in parallel. When recursing into child images (usually installed \fBipkg\fR branded non-global zones), update at most \fIn\fR child images in parallel. The default number of child images to update in parallel is 1. If \fIn\fR is 0 or a negative number, all child images are updated in parallel. See also \fBPKG_CONCURRENCY\fR in the "Environment Variables" section and \fBrecursion-concurrency\fR in the "Image Properties" section.

Temporarily add the specified package repository or archive to the list of sources in the image from which to retrieve package data. Repositories that require a client SSL certificate cannot be used with this option. This option can be specified multiple times.
.sp
When deciding which version of a package to use, publishers configured in the image, but not found in the specified \fIpath_or_uri\fR sources, take precedence. If the version of the package to be installed is provided by a publisher configured in the image and by a \fIpath_or_uri\fR source, the client retrieves the content for that package from the \fIpath_or_uri\fR sources. After installation or update, any packages provided by publishers not configured in the image are added to the image configuration without an origin. Use the \fBpkg publisher\fR command to see which publishers are configured in the image.

Run this operation in the global zone and also in all installed \fBipkg\fR branded non-global zones. The effect on the non-global zone is similar to logging into each non-global zone and running the command directly. Without this option, when you run \fBpkg\fR commands in the global zone, non-global zones are modified only to the extent required to keep them compatible with the global zone. With this option, the \fBpkg\fR operation is applied to all installed non-global zones except as limited by the \fB-z\fR and \fB-Z\fR options. Zones that are excluded by the \fB-z\fR and \fB-Z\fR options might still be modified if updates are required to keep them in sync with the global zone.  Recursion can be enabled by default for an image via the \fBdefault-recurse\fR package property; if this is set then it is not necessary to specify the \fB-r\fR option manually however the \fB-R\fR option can be specified to temporarily override recursion, see below.

Install or update the specified packages as if installing onto a bare system.

Packages are selected based on publisher search order and stickiness. See the \fBpkg publisher\fR and \fBpkg set-publisher\fR commands for information about search order and stickiness. If the \fIpkg_fmri_pattern\fR does not specify the publisher, the first publisher that provides a matching package is used as the installation source.

Each subcommand is capable of formulating some queries of which the other is capable. Care should be taken in choosing the subcommand, as a given query can be more naturally formulated in one than in the other.

By default, \fIquery\fR is interpreted as a series of terms to be matched exactly and multiple terms are ANDed.
.sp
AND and OR are supported.
.sp
The \fB?\fR and \fB*\fR characters can be used as \fBglob\fR(3C)\(hystyle wildcards, allowing more flexible query matches.
.sp
In addition to simple token matching and wildcard search, a more complicated query language is supported. Phrases can be searched for by using single or double quotation marks (\fB\&'\fR or \fB"\fR). Be sure to take your shell into account so that \fBpkg\fR actually sees the \fB\&'\fR or \fB"\fR.
.sp
Which tokens are indexed is action-dependent, but can include content hashes and path names. For information about actions and their attributes, see "Actions" in the \fBpkg\fR(7) man page. See also the list of pseudo attribute names in \fBpkg contents\fR and \fB-o\fR above.
.sp
Structured queries are supported with the following syntax:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fIpkg_name\fR:\fIaction_name\fR:\fIindex\fR:\fItoken\fR
.fi
.in -2

The value of \fIaction_name\fR is one of the actions listed in "Actions" in the \fBpkg\fR(7) man page. The \fIindex\fR is an attribute of the action. The value of \fIindex\fR must match \fItoken\fR.
.sp
Not all action attributes are searchable. For example, \fBmode\fR is an attribute of the \fBfile\fR action, but \fBmode\fR is not a valid value for \fIindex\fR.
.sp
Some values for \fIindex\fR are not action attributes but are values derived from other attributes. For example, \fIindex\fR can be \fBbasename\fR, which is not an attribute of any action but is derived from the \fBpath\fR attribute of the \fBfile\fR or \fBdir\fR action by taking the last component of the path.
.sp
Different action types have different valid values for \fIindex\fR. This documentation does not list all possible values. Some of the more useful \fIindex\fR values are \fBbasename\fR and \fBpath\fR for file system actions, the dependency type (for example, \fBrequire\fR, \fBoptional\fR, \fBgroup\fR) for \fBdepend\fR actions, and \fBdriver_name\fR and \fBalias\fR for \fBdriver\fR actions.
.sp
One special value for \fIindex\fR is the value of a \fBname\fR attribute for a \fBset\fR action. In this case, \fItoken\fR is matched against the value of the \fBvalue\fR attribute that corresponds to the specified \fBname\fR attribute. For example, the following search finds packages that are classified as either Development/Databases or System/Databases. In the "Examples" section, see the example of finding SMF services.
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ \fBpkg search info.classification:databases\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

Missing fields in a structured query are implicitly wildcarded. A search for \fBbasename:pkg\fR matches all actions in all packages that have an \fIindex\fR of \fBbasename\fR and that match the \fItoken\fR \fBpkg\fR, as shown in the following partial output:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ \fBpkg search basename:pkg\fR
INDEX    ACTION VALUE         PACKAGE
basename dir    usr/share/pkg pkg:/package/pkg@0.5.11-0.175.0.0.0.2.1
basename dir    var/sadm/pkg  pkg:/package/svr4@0.5.11-0.175.0.0.0.2.1
basename dir    var/spool/pkg pkg:/package/svr4@0.5.11-0.175.0.0.0.2.1
basename file   usr/bin/pkg   pkg:/package/pkg@0.5.11-0.175.0.0.0.2.1
.fi
.in -2
.sp

Adding another field narrows the search, as shown in the following complete output:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ \fBpkg search file:basename:pkg\fR
INDEX    ACTION VALUE       PACKAGE
basename file   usr/bin/pkg pkg:/package/pkg@0.5.11-0.175.0.0.0.2.1
.fi
.in -2
.sp

Explicit wildcards are supported in the \fIpkg_name\fR and \fItoken\fR fields. The \fIaction_name\fR and \fIindex\fR must match exactly.
.sp
See the "Examples" section for examples of searching for files and dependencies.
.sp
To convert actions to the packages that contain those actions, use \fB<>\fR, as shown in the following partial output:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
$ \fBpkg search \e<pkg\e>\fR
PACKAGE                                  PUBLISHER
pkg:/package/pkg@0.5.11-0.175.0.0.0.2.1  solaris
pkg:/package/svr4@0.5.11-0.175.0.0.0.2.1 solaris
.fi
.in -2
.sp

With the \fB-a\fR option (and by default), searching for \fBtoken\fR results in information about the actions that match \fBtoken\fR, while searching for \fB<token>\fR results in a list of packages that contain actions that match \fBtoken\fR.

Freeze the specified packages to the specified versions. If no version is given, the package must be installed and is frozen at that installed version. Freezing a package that is already frozen replaces the freeze version with the newly specified version.
.sp
When a package that is frozen is installed or updated, it must end up at a version that matches the version at which it was frozen. For example, if a package was frozen at 1.2, then it could be updated to 1.2.1, 1.2.9, 1.2.0.0.1, and so on. That package could not end up at 1.3, or 1.1. A publisher presented in the \fIpkg_fmri_pattern\fR is used to find matching packages. However, publisher information is not recorded as part of the freeze. A package is frozen with respect to its version only, not its publisher.

At the location given by \fIdir\fR, create an image suitable for package operations. Images created by using the \fBimage-create\fR subcommand are not bootable. Most users should use the \fB--be-name\fR or \fB--require-new-be\fR options with \fBpkg\fR commands, or use the \fBbeadm\fR or \fBzoneadm\fR commands to create images. The \fBpkg image-create\fR command is used for tasks such as maintaining packages and operating system distributions.

The default image type is user, which can be specified by using the \fB-U\fR or \fB--user\fR option. Alternatively, the image type can be set to a full image (\fB--F\fR or \fB--full\fR) or to a partial image (\fB-P\fR or \fB--partial\fR) linked to the full image enclosing the given \fIdir\fR path.
